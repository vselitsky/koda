### Added

- Env files named `.env-<model>.<quant>` — no default, always explicit
- Required variables (`HF_REPO`, `MODEL_DIR`, `MODEL_FILE`) must be set via env file — no hardcoded defaults
- opencode provider config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`
- Bundled profiles: Qwen3.5-27B (distilled), Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (Qwen + HauhauCS uncensored), Qwen3.5-9B (HauhauCS uncensored)
- Bundled profile for `gpt-oss-20b` via `ggml-org/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF`
- Bundled profile for `gpt-oss-120b` via `ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF`

### Changed

- `make serve` is now documented as the main entrypoint for both the built-in WebUI and the OpenAI-compatible API
- Default prompt handling now prefers the GGUF model's embedded Jinja template via `PROMPT_FORMAT=jinja`
- Added opinionated server batching defaults with `BATCH=512` and `UBATCH=512`
- Added `SERVER_EXTRA_ARGS` and `CHAT_EXTRA_ARGS` as structured escape hatches for advanced llama.cpp flags
- Renamed `AGENT.md` to `AGENTS.md`
- Added `make check` and friendlier missing-binary errors for `llama-server`, `llama-cli`, and `hf`
- Added `DOWNLOAD_INCLUDE` support so `make download` can fetch sharded GGUF models
- Added `RPC` passthrough support so `make serve` and `make chat` can use llama.cpp RPC backends
