## [2026-04-03]

### Added
- Added `.gitignore` — ignores model weights (`*.gguf`, `*.safetensors`, etc.), local env overrides, macOS metadata, editor files, and Trivy cache
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` — profile creation guide, 8-file update checklist, and pre-PR validation steps (`validate-profiles.sh`, `lychee`)
- Added `scripts/validate-profiles.sh` — checks all profiles for required fields and warns on duplicate aliases
- Added `compose.traefik.yml` override — Traefik network join and labels separated from base `compose.yaml`; base now uses `expose` only with no external network dependency
- Added `CADDY.md` — HTTPS guide for native `make serve` (local/LAN without Tailscale); clarifies when to use Caddy vs Tailscale vs Traefik
- Added `make smoke-test` target — hits `/health` on `HOST:PORT` and verifies `{"status":"ok"}`
- Added `dependabot.yml` — weekly automated PRs to keep GitHub Actions versions current
- Added memory reservation to `compose.yaml` (`MEM_RESERVE`, default `4g`) via `deploy.resources.reservations`
- Added CI: profile validation workflow (`.github/workflows/validate-profiles.yml`)
- Added CI: shellcheck workflow for `scripts/` (`.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml`)
- Added CI: link checker workflow using lychee (`.github/workflows/link-check.yml`)

- Added Qwen3.5-27B profiles: `.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M` and `.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q8_0` using `Jackrong/Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled-GGUF`
- Added Nemotron 3 Super 120B profile: `.env-Nemotron-3-Super-120B.Q4_K` using `ggml-org/Nemotron-3-Super-120B-GGUF` (69.9 GB, NVIDIA Nemotron H MoE)
- Added Gemma 4 E2B Instruct profiles: `.env-gemma-4-E2B-it.Q8_0` and `.env-gemma-4-E2B-it.F16` using `ggml-org/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF`

- Rewrote `profiles/README.md`: model-grouped layout, quantization guide, per-model variant tables
- Added `ALIAS` support to the `Makefile` and `compose-entrypoint.sh` to allow setting a consistent model ID for the OpenAI-compatible API
- Updated all `.env-*` model profiles with a specific `ALIAS` (e.g., `qwen3.5-27b`) to match external tool configurations
- Added sampling variables `TEMP` (default 0.6) and `TOP_P` (default 0.95) as structured overrides in the `Makefile`
- Added `CHAT_TPL` (default `chatml`) for explicit template control when `PROMPT_FORMAT=template`

- Added `make export-opencode` and `make export-vscode` to generate configuration snippets
- Added `make cache` target (`hf cache ls`) for inspecting the local Hugging Face model cache
- Added `make check-model` guard to `make serve` and `make chat` — fails immediately with a clear error if the model file is not found, preventing cryptic `invalid argument` errors
- Added healthcheck and `API_KEY` support to `compose.yaml` and `compose-entrypoint.sh`
- Added `CURSOR.md` integration guide — covers HTTPS requirement, setup steps, and deployment-path-aware options table (Traefik/Tailscale/Caddy)
- Added "Adding a New Model Profile" checklist to `AGENTS.md` listing all 8 files that must be updated in sync
- Added HuggingFace source URL as a comment (`# https://huggingface.co/...`) to the first line of every profile in `profiles/`
- Updated `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` and `chatLanguageModels.json` to include all 13 model aliases (Gemma 4, Qwen3.5, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek, Nemotron, Kimi-K2.5)
- Added curation credit to DimkaNYC across the documentation

### Changed
- Simplified Windows `make` prerequisite to WSL only — removed Git Bash and MSYS2 options; added `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git make` command
- Reduced redundancy across integration guides: replaced CURSOR.md alias table with a link to `profiles/README.md#api-identity-aliases`; collapsed OPENCODE.md and VSCODE.md compatibility notes to a single line linking to README Quick Start
- Clarified CURSOR.md HTTPS options: Tailscale noted as having built-in HTTPS; Caddy scoped to local/LAN only
- Reorganized documentation: moved `PROFILES.md` to `profiles/README.md` for better directory-level discoverability
- Moved all model profile `.env-*` files into the `profiles/` directory
- Rewrote `README.md` for significantly better human readability, including a new Table of Contents and "Built On" section
- Updated all integration guides (`OPENCODE.md`, `VSCODE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`) with the latest configuration variables and `profiles/` paths
- Updated `VSCODE.md` to document the `chatLanguageModels.json` format (`customoai` vendor) with all 13 individual model entries
- Replaced Mac Studio-specific hardware tier references with generic RAM/VRAM tier descriptions in `profiles/README.md`
- Fixed `make download` to pass each filename in `DOWNLOAD_INCLUDE` as a separate `--include` flag (via `$(foreach)`)
- Standardized Kimi-K2.5 size from GiB to GB across catalog and Recommended Starting Points
- Updated Trivy action from `@master` to `v0.35.0`; adopted `v`-prefixed tag per aquasecurity's supply chain security migration
- Bumped `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6 and `github/codeql-action` from v3 to v4 via Dependabot
- `make serve` now warns when `HOST` is not `127.0.0.1` and `API_KEY` is empty
- Traefik integration is now opt-in via `compose.traefik.yml` override — `docker compose up` no longer requires an external Traefik network
- CHANGELOG versioning corrected from SemVer to CalVer
- Linked Apache 2.0 LICENSE by name in README footer
- Aligned `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with current project state: WSL-only Windows, full targets table, Traefik override pattern, API key warning, `CADDY.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` in docs

### Fixed
- Fixed the `OPENCODE.md` integration guide to use the correct `provider` record and `options` schema required by OpenCode
- Fixed a corrupted `Makefile` that was causing syntax errors during `make serve`
- Fixed `make serve` hanging silently when a model was not yet downloaded — Makefile now searches `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` via `find -L` instead of `hf download`
- Fixed Qwen3.5-27B profile filenames; added `mmproj-BF16.gguf` to `DOWNLOAD_INCLUDE` as the repo includes a vision encoder
- Fixed tilde expansion in `Makefile` to ensure robust path handling for all model-related files
- Pushed `2026-03-27` tag to remote so CHANGELOG comparison URLs resolve
- Excluded `instagram.com` from lychee link checker (returns 429 for bots)
- Fixed lychee `--exclude-mail` flag (removed in v0.23.0); replaced with `--exclude 'mailto:'`

## [2026-03-27]

### Added
- Generic llama.cpp local inference setup with OpenAI-compatible API server
- `Makefile` with `serve`, `chat`, and `download` targets; `make` alone shows usage
- Env files named `.env-<model>.<quant>` — no default, always explicit
- Required variables (`HF_REPO`, `MODEL_DIR`, `MODEL_FILE`) must be set via env file — no hardcoded defaults
- opencode provider config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`
- Bundled profiles: Qwen3.5-27B (distilled), Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (Qwen + HauhauCS uncensored), Qwen3.5-9B (HauhauCS uncensored)
- Bundled profiles for `gpt-oss-20b`, `gpt-oss-120b`, `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`, and `Kimi-K2.5`
- Added `compose.yaml` as a containerized deployment path using the official upstream `llama.cpp` image
- Added Traefik labels for the Compose deployment path
- Simplified the Compose deployment path to rely on `.env`, `expose`, and the external `traefik` network
- Added Hugging Face cache volume to `compose.yaml` to share models from the default cache location
- Added default `MODEL_DIR` and `MODEL_FILE` to `.env` to fix Docker Compose interpolation errors
- Added GitHub Action workflow for Trivy security scanning of the repository
- Added documentation for `TAILSCALE.md`, `VSCODE.md`, `GGUF.md`, and `AGENTS.md`

### Changed
- `make serve` is now documented as the main entrypoint for both the built-in WebUI and the OpenAI-compatible API
- Default prompt handling now prefers the GGUF model's embedded Jinja template via `PROMPT_FORMAT=jinja`
- Added opinionated server batching defaults with `BATCH=512` and `UBATCH=512`
- Added `SERVER_EXTRA_ARGS` as a structured escape hatch for advanced llama-server flags
- Added `make check` and friendlier missing-binary errors for `llama-server`, `llama-cli`, and `hf`
- Added `DOWNLOAD_INCLUDE` support so `make download` can fetch sharded GGUF models
- Added `RPC` passthrough support so `make serve` and `make chat` can use llama.cpp RPC backends
- Changed default GPU offload from `99` to `-1` to match modern llama.cpp usage better
- Added `METRICS=1` support for exposing llama-server metrics
