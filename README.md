# Koda: Local LLM Orchestrator 🎛️

Koda is a lightweight configuration and orchestration layer for running GGUF models locally. It provides a standardized environment for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), making it easy to download, serve, and chat with models without memorizing complex CLI flags.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Minutes)

Get up and running on macOS or Linux in just a few commands.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Choose a path:

**Option A — macOS / Linux (native)**
```bash
brew install llama.cpp huggingface-cli fzf
```

**Option B — Windows (native)**
```powershell
winget install ggml-org.llama.cpp
winget install junegunn.fzf
winget install Python.Python.3
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
```
> `make` is required on Windows. Use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/).

**Option C — Docker (no dependencies except Docker itself)**
```bash
docker compose --env-file profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M up -d
```
No `make`, no `brew`, no binaries to install. See [Docker Compose](#-docker-compose) for GPU support details.

### 2. Verify Environment
```bash
make check
```

### 3. Download & Serve
Pick a model profile (see [profiles/README.md](./profiles/README.md)) and start the server. 

**Smart Path Resolution:** Koda automatically looks for models in your `MODEL_DIR` first, and falls back to the default **Hugging Face cache** if not found. You don't need to move files manually!

```bash
make download ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M
make serve    ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M
```
*Your server is now live at `http://localhost:8080` with an OpenAI-compatible API at `/v1`.*

**Tip:** Use `make list` to see all profiles or `make select` for an interactive picker.

---

## 🛠️ Key Workflows

Koda is built around a simple `make` workflow. Every command requires an `ENV` file pointing to a model profile in `profiles/`.

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make serve` | Starts the **WebUI** and **OpenAI-compatible API** server. |
| `make chat` | Launches an **interactive terminal session** with the model. |
| `make download` | Fetches the model weights from Hugging Face using `hf-cli`. |
| `make list` | Lists all available model profiles in `profiles/`. |
| `make select` | Interactively select a model profile (requires `fzf` or `gum`). |
| `make check` | Verifies your local environment and required binaries. |

### Common Overrides
You can tune the performance directly from the command line:
```bash
# Change the port or restrict the context window
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M PORT=9090 CTX=8192

# Enable metrics and set an API key
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M METRICS=1 API_KEY=my-secret

# Enable advanced features like speculative decoding or multimodal support
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M DRAFT_MODEL=./draft.gguf
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose

The Docker path requires only Docker — no `make`, no `brew`, no local binaries. The official `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp` image is used.

```bash
# Start with a specific model profile
docker compose --env-file profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M up -d
```

### GPU Support in Docker

| Platform | GPU in Docker | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NVIDIA (Linux)** | ✅ Full | Requires [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). `compose.yaml` passes `--gpus all` automatically. |
| **AMD (Linux)** | ✅ Full | Set `LLAMA_CPP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm` in `.env`. |
| **Apple Silicon (macOS)** | ❌ CPU only | Docker on macOS runs in a Linux VM — Metal/GPU is not accessible. |
| **Windows** | ❌ CPU only | Same VM limitation. NVIDIA passthrough is possible via WSL2 but not officially supported here. |

> **Apple Silicon and Windows users:** the `Makefile` path (Options A / B above) is required to get GPU acceleration. Docker is fine for CPU-only use or quick testing.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

Koda is **local-first**. Your data never leaves your machine. 

- **Privacy:** No telemetry, no tracking, no cloud dependencies.
- **Integrity:** We use [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) for automated vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning via GitHub Actions.

## 🏗️ Built On

Koda is a thin layer standing on the shoulders of giants:

| Project | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** | Inference engine — provides `llama-server` (API + WebUI) and `llama-cli` (terminal chat) |
| **[huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli)** | Model downloader — `make download` uses `hf` to fetch GGUF files from HuggingFace |
| **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** | Interactive profile picker — primary backend for `make select` |
| **[gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)** | Interactive profile picker — alternative backend for `make select` if fzf is not installed |
| **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** | Containerized deployment path — no local binaries required |
| **[Traefik](https://traefik.io/)** | Reverse proxy — provides HTTPS termination in the Docker Compose path |
| **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)** | Private network — secure remote access and multi-machine RPC pooling |
| **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)** | Security scanning — automated vulnerability checks via GitHub Actions |
