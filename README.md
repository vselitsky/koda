# Koda: Local LLM Orchestrator 🎛️

Koda is a lightweight configuration and orchestration layer for running GGUF models locally. It provides a standardized environment for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), making it easy to download, serve, and chat with models without memorizing complex CLI flags.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Minutes)

Get up and running on macOS or Linux in just a few commands.

### 1. Install Dependencies

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
brew install llama.cpp huggingface-cli fzf
```

**Windows**
```powershell
winget install ggml-org.llama.cpp
winget install junegunn.fzf
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
```
> `make` is required on Windows. Use [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/).

### 2. Verify Environment
```bash
make check
```

### 3. Download & Serve
Pick a model profile (see [profiles/README.md](./profiles/README.md)) and start the server. 

**Smart Path Resolution:** Koda automatically looks for models in your `MODEL_DIR` first, and falls back to the default **Hugging Face cache** if not found. You don't need to move files manually!

```bash
make download ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M
make serve    ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M
```
*Your server is now live at `http://localhost:8080` with an OpenAI-compatible API at `/v1`.*

**Tip:** Use `make list` to see all profiles or `make select` for an interactive picker.

## 🛠️ Key Workflows

Koda is built around a simple `make` workflow. Every command requires an `ENV` file pointing to a model profile in `profiles/`.

| Command | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make serve` | Starts the **WebUI** and **OpenAI-compatible API** server. |
| `make chat` | Launches an **interactive terminal session** with the model. |
| `make download` | Fetches the model weights from Hugging Face using `hf-cli`. |
| `make list` | Lists all available model profiles in `profiles/`. |
| `make select` | Interactively select a model profile (requires `fzf` or `gum`). |
| `make check` | Verifies your local environment and required binaries. |

### Common Overrides
You can tune the performance directly from the command line:
```bash
# Change the port or restrict the context window
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M PORT=9090 CTX=8192

# Enable metrics and set an API key
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M METRICS=1 API_KEY=my-secret

# Enable advanced features like speculative decoding or multimodal support
make serve ENV=profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M DRAFT_MODEL=./draft.gguf
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose

For a "set it and forget it" deployment (e.g., on a home server), use the provided `compose.yaml`:

```bash
# Start the default model
docker compose up -d

# Run a specific profile
docker compose --env-file profiles/.env-Qwen3.5-27B.Q4_K_M up -d
```

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

Koda is **local-first**. Your data never leaves your machine. 

- **Privacy:** No telemetry, no tracking, no cloud dependencies.
- **Integrity:** We use [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) for automated vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning via GitHub Actions.

## 🏗️ Built On

Koda is a thin layer standing on the shoulders of giants:
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** — The engine.
- **[huggingface-cli](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/cli)** — The supply line.
